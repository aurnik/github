This is a almost 100% final product for DVC. The website does not have have cross browser functionality and seems to only run on chrome and safari, not mozilla and doubtfully IE. A key note to this website is the form is made with php and must have a server to talk to for functioning. If this is not supported by my Profile we provided a form.html to show the visual aspect until we get the website loaded to DVC personal space.

I anticipate we will have the events page, media page, calendar page, & booking page will all last a while. We set up a database but are inticipating that someone may enter in a field wrong and we didn't do any validation checks other than just parsing the JSON object retrieved from our API"S. We will have to do some checks in the future months to make sure everything is still running smoothly. This may be a monthly thing on our to do list since we are closely established with some of the club members, we dont mind doing it!
