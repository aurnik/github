<h1>A little history...</h1>
<p>Since it's inception in 1997, the DJs and Vinylphiles Club at UCSD, originated as the brainchild of two UCSD graduate students, Jason Trama and Scott Burkette.  With an interest in the art of DJing as well as a desire to envigorate UCSD parties, Jason and Scott decided to form a student organization. In April of 1997, Jason and Scott lured two other grad students, Dan Kalafus and Eric Elenko, into their organization... and thus, the Mobile DeeJays and Vinylphiles at UCSD was created. Preaching a dedication to sharing ideas on DJing, rave culture and music, the four gathered with a handful of undergrads with similar interests.<br /><br />

From here, things gained slow momentum: money was scarce and the core members were inexperienced with the bureaucracy of running a student organization. In addition, as a graduate student club, DVC could not ask for Associated Students funding, which severely hampered its ability to throw events.  It was eventually decided that the fantastic four would give up their principal membership to the undergraduates as they had more time, energy, and the ability to ask for A.S. funding. The name was changed to the DeeJays and Vinylphiles Club, and the club entered a new era under its first president, Justin Boggs.  Enrollment flourished in the club, club visibility expanded, and they established much-deserved recognition from the campus and administration.<br /><br />

Within a year, DVC started to throw more events and seminars for its members as well as other students. Today, DVC is constantly training new DJs and organizing events with attendances of 100-2500 students. We are enjoying a popularity not usually seen among student organizations and continue to develop a group of people who are influential to the electronic music scene in San Diego.</p><br />
<h1>Our mission & goals</h1>
<p>The DeeJays and Vinylphiles Club at UCSD, or DVC, was created as a source of support and information for electronic music and all forms of its expression. DVC is dedicated to training members in the arts of DeeJaying, mixing, music production, and promotion. Members are able to experience almost every level of DJ culture by participation in organizing events on campus.  These events serve not only to display members' talent and dedication, but also to entertain, educate, and interact with an audience - the students of UCSD. DVC's main focus is, and will always be, the enjoyment of music. This defines us, evolves us, and transcends us. We only hope that through our energy, enthusiasm, and effort that those in attendance will understand and respect this principle. We exist only of and for the music, so come listen and dance: bring some life into this sleepy little eucalyptus grove!</p><br />
